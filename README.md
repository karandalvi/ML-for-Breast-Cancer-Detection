# ml-breast-cancer-detection
Used machine learning libraries in Python (<a href=https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn>scikit-learn</a>) to learn breast cancer data and train a model. This model is then used to predict breast cancer in the test data.
Achieved error rates of less than 4% on both training and test data.
